# DataSync1.0
This was one of my first repos I ever made around freshman or sophomore year of high school. It's not complete by a long show and it took way to long to even get to where it was. But, I'm keeping it because it reminds me where I started.

I had this whole grand vision for syncing my files between my laptop and desktop (both hand me down, older machines). At the time of making this project I didn't know how it should work. But, I kept thinking about this idea for a while.

Flash forward to about senior year of high school and I had white board drawings in my room of how I wanted it to work. I moved to building a CLI program instead of a GUI. And I had thought through some of the beginnings of the major problems of syncing files (like if you make an edit on both machines at once, how do you sync them??) Shortly after all this, I learned that I was just rebuilding rsync... Then shortly after that I learned that what I was really rebuilding is called syncthing. And now I just use syncthing...
